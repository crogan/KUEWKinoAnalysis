# KUEWKinoAnalysis
**KUEWKinoAnalysis** code package implementing the KU EWKino Analysis

---------------------
CMSSW-dependent build 
---------------------

In order for the KUEWKinoAnalysis package to build the `BuildFit.x`
executable, the user must make sure that **CMSSW** is available, and
include the **KEWKinoAnalysis** package in the correct location in the
**CMSSW** directory structure. You will also need the **CombineHarvester**
and **HiggsAnalysis** **CMSSW** packages. These packages must be included
in the **CMSSW** directory structure as:

	- CMSSW_Z_Y_X
	  - src
		- CombineHarvester
		- HiggsAnalysis
		- KUEWKinoAnalysis

You can set up a **CMSSW** area and checkout the required packages by
performing the terminal commands below. 

### Setting up environmental variables for CMSSW
These are commands that I have in my `.bash_profile` script on the
T3 that get called at terminal startup

	>$ source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
	>$ source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/crab3/crab.sh
	>$ export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
	
### Setting up CMSSW area
You will probably need CMSSW_10_2_X or later

	>$ scram project CMSSW CMSSW_Z_Y_X
	>$ cd CMSSW_Z_Y_X/src
	>$ cmsenv
	
### Checking out required packages
	>$ git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
	>$ git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester.git CombineHarvester
	>$ git clone https://github.com/crogan/KUEWKinoAnalysis.git KUEWKinoAnalysis
	
### Build/compile  everything
Build the CMSSW packages (*Note: We're still in the* `CMSSW_Z_Y_X/src` *directory*)

	>$ scram b
Build **KUEWKinoAnalysis** (with the `BuildFit.x` executable). (*Note:
at this point you will need to have set the **RestFrames**
environmental varables set, i.e. have done* `source setup_RestFrames.sh`)

	>$ cd KUEWKinoAnalysis
	>$ make CMSSW
