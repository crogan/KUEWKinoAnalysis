# KUEWKinoAnalysis
**KUEWKinoAnalysis** code package implementing the KU EWKino Analysis

---------------------
CMSSW-dependent build 
---------------------

In order for the KUEWKinoAnalysis package to build the `BuildFit.x`
executable, the user must make sure that **CMSSW** is available, and
include the **KEWKinoAnalysis** package in the correct location in the
**CMSSW** directory structure. You will also need the **CombineHarvester**
and **HiggsAnalysis** **CMSSW** packages. These packages must be included
in the **CMSSW** directory structure as:

	- CMSSW_Z_Y_X
	  - src
		- CombineHarvester
		- HiggsAnalysis
		- KUEWKinoAnalysis

You can set up a **CMSSW** area and checkout the required packages by
performing the terminal commands below. 

### Setting up environmental variables for CMSSW
These are commands that I have in my `.bash_profile` script on the
T3 that get called at terminal startup

	>$ source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
	>$ source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/crab3/crab.sh
	>$ export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
	
### Setting up CMSSW area
You will need CMSSW_10_6_5

	>$ scram project CMSSW CMSSW_10_6_5
	>$ cd CMSSW_10_6_5/src
	>$ cmsenv
	
### Checking out required packages
	>$ git clone https://github.com/zflowers/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
	>$ git clone https://github.com/zflowers/CombineHarvester.git CombineHarvester
	>$ git clone https://github.com/crogan/KUEWKinoAnalysis.git KUEWKinoAnalysis
Switch to the KU branch in HiggsAnalysis and the connect branch in CombineHarvester
	>$ git checkout KU	
	>$ git checkout connect


### Build/compile  everything
Build the CMSSW packages (*Note: We're still in the* `CMSSW_10_6_5/src` *directory*)

	>$ scram b
Build **KUEWKinoAnalysis** (with the `BuildFit.x` executable). (*Note:
at this point you will need to have set the **RestFrames**
environmental varables set, i.e. have done* `source setup_RestFrames.sh`)

	>$ cd KUEWKinoAnalysis
	>$ make cmssw


### Running combineTool.py on cms connect syntax
To run text2workspace (T2W):
Go to the directory with the datacard for a given mass point

	>$ combineTool.py -M T2W -i datacard.txt -m MASS_Value --job-mode connect -o workspace.root --input-file ../../../FitInput_KUEWKino_2017.root --sub-opts='+ProjectName=cms.org.ku" \n request_memory = 8 GB \n'

Note that mass value will typically be the name of the directory that the datacard is in (ex: 5000325) and the input file is the path to the output root file from BuildFit.x

To run AsymptoticLimits:
Go to the directory that was the output of BuildFit.x 

	>$ combineTool.py -M AsymptoticLimits -d */*/*/datacard.txt --job-mode connect --input-file FitInput_KUEWKino_2017.root --sub-opts='+ProjectName="cms.org.ku" \n request_memory = 8 GB \n'

To run impacts:
Go to the directory that the workspace (and datacard) live in

	>$ combineTool.py -M Impacts -d workspace.root -m MASS_Value --doInitialFit --robustFit 1 --job-mode connect --sub-opts='+ProjectName="cms.org.ku" \n request_memory = 8 GB \n'
	>$ combineTool.py -M Impacts -d workspace.root -m 5000325 --input-file ../ --job-mode connect --sub-opts='+ProjectName="cms.org.ku" \n request_memory = 8 GB \n' 

Note that the second step only should be ran after the jobs in the first step finish
The input file is just the entire directory that the workspace lives in
